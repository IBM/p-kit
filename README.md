# p-kit
Python library for the simulation of probabilistic circuits.

A probablilstic computers can be either an software emulator or implemented in hardware. Several hardware implementations are proposed: optical (...) and Ardiono. 

There are similarities between the p-bits and the q-bits. We would like to explore the possibility of using p-bits in a smilar way to q-bits. This will allow Quantum circuits to be executed on a probalistic computer instead of a quantum computer.

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/IBM/p-kit/wiki) for more information on probabilistic computers.
